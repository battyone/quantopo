# Quantopo

Quantopo is a quantum machine learning project focused on leveraging 
the geometry of quantum mechanics within quantum computers to improve 
on tools in statistical modeling and topological data analysis. 

As of today, this repo contains work on Quantopo's first proof-of-concept with a continuous-variable quantum architecture model of integrated photonic circuits (under projects/QGLM/Xanadu) and data-driven quantum circuit learning with Rigetti's quantum backend (under projects/DDQCL/Rigetti). Proprietary algorithms are developed in-house. Our open-sourced quantum algorithms under research and development will be released periodically.

Moreover, proper documentation is coming soon. In the meantime, checkout this Quantum Machine Learning (QML) course to get up to speed on QML: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:University_of_TorontoX+UTQML101x+1T2019/course/.
