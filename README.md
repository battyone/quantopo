# quantopo

Project Quantopo entails quantum programming development for areas of quantum machine learning. This project was initially inspired by the published work of Seth Lloyd, Silvano Garnerone, and Paolo Zanardi in 'Quantum algorithms for topological and geometrical analysis of data' and Scott Aaronson's critique of the work in 'Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms: Read the Fine Print'.

Proper documentation coming soon. (Signed 03/13/18)
