# Quantopo

Quantopo is a quantum machine learning company focused on leveraging 
the geometry of quantum mechanics within quantum computers to improve 
on tools in statistical modeling and topological data analysis. 

As of today, this repo contains work on Quantopo's first proof-of-concept with continuous variable quantum architecture (under projects/QGLM/Xanadu) and data driven quantum circuit learning with Rigetti's quantum backend (under projects/DDQCL/Rigetti). Proprietary algorithms are developed in-house. Other quantum algorithms under research and development are being investigated and uploaded.

Proper documentation is coming soon. In the meantime, checkout this Quantum Machine Learning (QML) course to get up to speed on QML: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:University_of_TorontoX+UTQML101x+1T2019/course/.
