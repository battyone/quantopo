    "One mechanism is Quantum Teleportation. To achieve, a sequence of steps must be followed by both Alice and Bob. First, Alice must entangle her half of the Bell Pair with the qubit $|\\psi>$. Following that, she must measure both qubits, her half of the Bell Pair and qubit $|\\psi>$. Then, she must send those measurements to Bob, where Bob will use those measurements to determine what actions he must take to gain information about the state of the qubit $|\\psi>$. In this case, based on the measurements Bob receives, he will have to do 1 of 4 things, through the use of an X gate and/or Z gate. If he receives a measurement of 00, he won't have to do anything to his own half of the Bell Pair. His half already represents the state $|\\psi>$. If he receives a measurement of 01, he will have to apply an X gate to his own half of the Bell Pair. If he receives a measurement of 10, he will have to apply a Z gate to his own half of the Bell Pair. Last, if he receives a measurement of 11, he will have to first apply a X gate, followed by a Z gate. \n",
