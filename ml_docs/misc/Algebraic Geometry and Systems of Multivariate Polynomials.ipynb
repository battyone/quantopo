    "Many systems of polynomials are hard to solve. However, in essence, the set of solutions for these systems depend just on their generated ideals, which is essentially the set of all possible linear combinations given the generated set. In essence, an ideal is a general subset of a ring, in which a ring is a fundamental algebraic structure in abstract algebra. A ring is composed of two binary operations that generalize addition and multiplication. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, as a consequence, replacing the generating set of an ideal by a different generating set of the same ideal won't change the solution of the system and the new generating set may make the computation of the systems solutions easier to compute. This brings us to one of the central fields of mathematics: Algebraic Geometry. In classical algebraic geometry, the central theme of study is systems of multivariate polynomial functions; essentially, the study of zeros, defined as algebraic varieties, for simultaneous multivariate polynomials.

    "To date, a body of work in numerical algebraic geometry has sprung forth with various techniques for numerically examining and manipulating algebraic varieties; hence, techniques are brought forth for solving systems of polynomials. One approach is seen as a multivariate, non-linear generalization of Euclid's algorithm for computation of polynomial's greatest common divisors and Gaussian elimination for linear systems. This computational approach, defined as Buchberger's algorithm, uses Grobner basis (briefly defined below) for solving systems of polynomial equations.\n",
