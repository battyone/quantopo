# I had some fun at 'Hands-on Introduction to Machine Learning using Watson Studio Workshop'

Check out the content: https://github.com/bleonardb3/ML_POT_03-27 #:)

Offered by IBM (Mclean, VA)

The magic studio of IBM's Watson Studio. Learn the whole nine of Data Science, from data requirements and data collections to deployment and feedback (and of course building, training, and testing machine learning/deep learning models). Materials in the linked repository above lead you through nine hands-on labs. Do your own homework ;)
