    "In 2009, the discovery of the HHL quantum algorithm extended the potential applicability of future quantum computers beyond just accelerated simulation of quantum physics and chemistry to accelerated computation in machine learning (Harrow, Hassidam, Lloyd, 2009). Classically, solving a linear system, Ax ⃗= b ⃗, where A is a N x N sparse matrix with a condition number κ, solves for x ⃗ in O(N√κ) using the best known classical algorithm, whereas HHL quantum algorithm solves for x ⃗ in poly(log N, κ) time (Harrow, Hassidam, Lloyd, 2009). That claim is yet defeated when accounting for the expensive load required for preparing the vector state b ⃗ of the linear system from a quantum RAM (S. Aaronson)."

    "Provided here is a potential analytic workaround, to the quantum RAM expensive load problem; potentially, memory requirement of the quantum RAM may be exponentially suppressed using a quantum algorithm applicable to a different data analytic tool. This alternative is the quantum algorithm for topological data analysis (QTDA), founded by Seth Lloyd, Silvano Garnerone, and Paolo Zanardi (2015), which, with techniques of topology, offers a way to extract information from noisy, unstructured data. The quantum algorithm applied to TDA achieves an exponential suppression of the memory requirement for the quantum RAM, requiring just O(n^2) bits, as opposed to O(2^n) bits as in HHL (S. Aaronson).

Here, development is done using ProjectQ, an open-source software framework for quantum computing. This framework utilizes IBM’s quantum processing backend for processing. Following a recent experiment (Huang et al 2018), we use ProjectQ to replicate the five-qubits circuit experiment that analyzes the topological features of Betti numbers for a network of three data points."
